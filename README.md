# Project Description

## AI Prompt Search

AI Prompt Search is a web-based application that allows users to interact with Google's Generative AI models. Users can input a prompt, and the backend communicates with the Google Generative AI API to generate AI-powered responses, which are then displayed on the frontend. The application is built using Node.js, Express.js for the backend, and plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

Features
AI-powered Search: Users can enter any prompt to get responses generated by Google's Generative AI models.
Dynamic Responses: The app dynamically displays AI-generated content on the frontend.
Interactive UI: The user interface is simple, responsive, and styled with CSS for a clean user experience.
Error Handling: Graceful handling of errors ensures that users receive meaningful feedback in case of issues with the API or the server.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: Web framework used for handling HTTP requests and serving static files.
Google Generative AI API: Used to generate AI responses based on user prompts.
Body-Parser: Middleware to parse incoming JSON request bodies.
Frontend:
HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling the user interface.
JavaScript: For handling user input and dynamically updating the content on the page.
How It Works
Users enter a prompt into the input box on the webpage.
The prompt is sent to the server via an API call using fetch.
The backend communicates with Google's Generative AI API, passing the prompt and receiving a response.
The AI-generated content is returned to the frontend and displayed dynamically.
Installation & Setup
Prerequisites:
Node.js installed on your machine.
A valid API key for the Google Generative AI service.
